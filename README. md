##Name:topology identification
##Introduction
The code is mainly used to simulate the multi-scale complex network model and identify the unknown parameters in the 
network through the evolution of the algorithm. 
The iterations in the project are all Euler's forward difference method.
The Brownian motion in the model is simulated with normally distributed random numbers.
##User guide
The program can run using the 2016-2020 version of matlab
